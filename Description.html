    <h3>Data Description</h3>
    <p>The dataset represents lottery draw results recorded from 2010 to 2025, showing how frequently each ball number was drawn and when it was last selected. Each entry includes three key variables: Ball Number, Times Drawn, and Last Drawn Date. The Ball Number identifies the specific lottery ball, Times Drawn indicates how often that number appeared during a given period, and Last Drawn Date records the most recent time it was drawn. In the visualization, a scatter plot is used to display this information clearly.</p>

    <h3>Why This Dataset Is Interesting</h3>
    <p>This dataset is particularly engaging because it connects mathematical probability with real-world data. Many people associate the lottery with luck, yet rarely consider how randomness behaves statistically. By examining the frequency of drawn numbers, we can observe whether true randomness produces an even spread or if some numbers appear slightly more often by coincidence.</p>

    <h3>Visualization Choice Reasoning</h3>
    <p>A scatter plot was selected because it effectively shows relationships between two numerical variables — Ball Number and Times Drawn. It provides a clear view of overall distribution, outliers, and clustering, allowing for easy visual interpretation. Interactive features such as dropdown menus and tooltips enhance the analytical experience.</p>
